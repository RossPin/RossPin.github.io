          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>
            I think life looks much better when viewed through a lens of looking at all types of happiness. I agree with the idea that we place too much importance on the unsustainable pleasure form of happiness and ignore the other two. Only concentrating on the pleasure aspect can lead to a rather bleak outlook on life as it seems to hold little happiness. By recognizing and seeking the other types of happiness we can come to view our lives as full of happiness.

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h4>
          <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
          <p>
            My core values would be honesty, kindness and self-control. 
          </p>
          <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
          <p>
            I stand for freedom to live your life in ways that make you happy and fulfilled. And not doing things just because it is 'the way it's done'. 
          </p>
          <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>
            I thought it was a good exercise and can see benefits on training yourself to just observe failure and success and not let it overcome you. Personally, how I try to deal with failure is to reflect on the experience and find what success there may be in the outcome. Refocusing experiences to be successful rather than failures is the approach I would rather take. It can be a slow process and may take a few days to overcome the feeling of failure which is where I think this exercise could be useful. Doing this exercise and trying to think of times of failure to focus on made me realise that my methods must be working as I struggled to remember times of failure. My methods of moving on from failure are in no way perfect but they work for me and I fell I can benefit by increasing my self-awareness of how I cope with things.
