    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>
      It seems to be a completely different type of learning environment than what I’d be used to. It looks to go a lot further than just learning to code.
    </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      I like the concept that it is developing you in all ways that will gear you towards becoming a good developer. I liked Shereef's analogy of kitchen or table experience. It does seem that there would be a lot more to gain from getting involved with the kitchen attitude than expecting learning to be served to you in nice polished fashion.
    </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
      I think I will be able to engage with this culture effectively. It definitely sounds like some of it will be pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, but I will gain a lot more from the experience by engaging in the EDA culture.
    </p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>
      My expectations have changed somewhat in that I now have a better idea of what to expect. This will be a completely different experience than any other learning I have done in the past. I already expected it to be different than other learning but couldn’t really imagine how, so at the same time my expectations were still half leaning to a more traditional learning environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes I am excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I think a lot of aspects to this type of learning environment will be very beneficial to me. I want to get the most out of this experience and get a good start in my journey as a developer. Yes definitely nervous about it all as it will be pushing boundaries, but mostly excited.
