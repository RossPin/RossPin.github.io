          <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership? </h4>
          <p>
            In past employment I have had employers who practiced compassionate leadership similar to what was outlined in this chapter. I found the effect of this style of leadership was that it made me reciprocally care about them. This leads to me caring about how my performance at work affects them and changes my perspective of goals at work. I would put more effort into achieving what was required for the company, which I was a part of to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it wasn’t for compassionate leadership I would have viewed work related tasks differently. I would have seen them as chores that I would rather not do. I probably would have done things to the minimum standard so that I could say that they were done and wouldn’t have been overly concerned if deadlines weren't met.

          <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>
            I found this to be quite a pleasant meditation exercise. It was a nice feeling visualising all the goodness and absorbing it. I did find it quite difficult to visualise goodness, that was a strange concept. But towards the end of each section I felt I was getting a visualisation of the goodness we were supposed to be focusing on.

          <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>
            This was an interesting exercise, I found it easier to do than the multiplying goodness exercise because I found it easier to visualise negative feelings than overall goodness. I think mainly because it is an emotion I can directly relate to whereas goodness felt more of an abstract concept. I found the process of absorbing the negative and emitting positive emotions to be an overall good experience. It was great that the negative emotions were followed by the positive feeling of emitting goodness, meaning each cycle ended on a positive note leaving me feeling good. I can see that this could be a useful practice to apply at times.

          <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>
            There have certainly been times through the phase 0 experience where elements of the SCARF model have been noticeably been at play. These are mostly to do with the threat aspect of the social influence scale. Some aspects of the assignments have activated a fear or nervousness response due to one or more of the SCARF categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            During bootcamp I'm sure that many situations will invoke feelings that can be categorised in the SCARF model. I will need to be aware of these and look at things objectively. I will try to be aware of positive influences and place more importance in them and be realistic about negative influences. This is to try and balance out the exaggerated way we let negative experiences affect us more than positive ones.

          <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h4>
          <p>
            I found the hardest part of the difficult conversation was bringing the subject up and starting the conversation in the first place. I did the mental preparations before having the conversation which kind of increased my nervousness about the conversation but also made me feel more prepared. Once I started the conversation things kind of flowed easily from there and I was glad I had prepared for the conversation and I was able to calmly lead it and ensure all the important information was delivered without creating negative feelings.
