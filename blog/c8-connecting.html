          <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
          <p>
            I have tried the informal version of this a few times when having meaningful conversations. I feel this to be a very worthwhile approach and find it to enhance my understanding of the other person. It makes listening much easier because you feel in touch with what the other person is saying. It makes you care much more about their point of view when you are viewing it from there perspective, particularly useful when you may not be that interested in what they are talking about.
          </p>
          <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
          <p>
            It was quite a nice meditation exercise. Picturing someone else and viewing all the ways they are the same as you kind of makes you feel closer to them.

          <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>

            <strong>Me -</strong> That is how I would like to do it, it's what I feel comfortable with and is what I would enjoy the most. If it's meant to be about me why is she insisting on doing things I don’t want, to make other people happy. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Them -</strong> I don’t understand why he doesn't want to do it like this. It will only be a minor inconvenience for him and doing it his way will only upset people that care about him. He just needs to get over it because it has to be done this way.
