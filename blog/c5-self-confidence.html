          <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
          <p>
            The relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness is very close. The two concepts are highly interlinked. The processes to access them are very similar and in many ways, they could be describing the same thing. If you develop your mindfulness skills your self-awareness will also be improved and vice versa. 
          </p>
          <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
          <p>
            I tried the body scan exercise. The idea seemed strange and at the start I couldnâ€™t help anticipating the whole exercise and thinking about all the body parts involved. By the end of the first two minutes of breathing I had got it kind of in control and could put substantial focus on the individual body parts for their time. I was surprised to find that the part of my body I was focusing on actually did feel different to the rest of my body, it's hard to describe but it almost felt heavier or denser while I was focusing on it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It was interesting reading about how this technique can help with getting to sleep, and I will try doing this before sleeping to see if it helps me sleep better.

          <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
          <p>
            I liked how he described emotions as just being emotions, and not defining yourself by how your feeling. Viewing emotions in that light will be beneficial to being able to cope with emotions and not react to them. Whilst still being aware that they are there so they can be processed properly and not buried.
