          <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is not something I’ve really considered before. Some of the aspects ive been kind of aware of but never thought it to be of much importance. It was interesting to read about the importance of emotional intelligence and it being as or more important than intellectual intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve certainly always considered being able to think logically as the most important, and not given much regards to emotional intelligence. Reading through the chapter and reflecting on myself I don’t think I have bad emotional intelligence but it is certainly an area I could do with improving on.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a lot to take in with this chapter and to be honest I’ve already forgotten a lot of the techniques and aspects mentioned even though I just finished reading it. I Think I will re-read the chapter in a day or two and see if more sinks in. And possibly try reading further into the book.

          <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
          <p>
            I found it quite hard to maintain mindfulness and not let my mind wander and start thinking about other things. I needed to use the technique of concentrating on breathing the whole way through, but the two minutes was over pretty quick. I found it to be a pleasant experience and could be useful on a regular basis. It is defiantly something that I will need practice at to not get distracted.
