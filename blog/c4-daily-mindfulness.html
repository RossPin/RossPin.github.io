          <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
          <p>
            It feels quite strange to talk for 3 minutes, Iâ€™m much more comfortable with saying small bits and then waiting for a response. There were some periods of silence just thinking what to say. It was also quite hard not to respond till the end rather than responding to every point as its made. The looping back at the end was an excellent technique for ensuring that we both understood what we were saying. We both found the exercise interesting and it could be worthwhile doing again. 
          </p>
          <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
          <p>
            The one breath a day technique sounded like a good one for me. I easily manage to fit in at least one breath a day. It's something I can just do when I think of it and not have to try planning a time to do it. I think this way I will be much more relaxed and get more out of it than if I set aside a specific time each day. I imagine most times I will be able to manage much more than one breath and it could start to become a much more natural habit. 
          </p>
          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>
            I Liked the concept of mindful walking, it will be a good alternative to mindfulness meditation. It is something I can see myself enjoying much more.
