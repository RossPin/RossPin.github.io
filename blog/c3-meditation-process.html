          <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? </h4>
          <p>
            I followed the process of structuring the site how I wanted it before adding any stylings or content to the site. It seemed strange while doing it and I seemed to be spending a lot of time with the site still looking horrible. But then It all came together really easy at the end because all the hard structuring was done.
          </p>
          <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? </h4>
          <p>
            I didn't think much of meditation before reading this chapter. I just viewed meditation as some strange thing that some people are into. Mostly meditation is only something I’ve seen in movies and TV, I can't think of ever hearing about meditation from a real person.
          </p>
          <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
          <p>
            It's not just sitting in a funny position with a blank mind. Its exercising your mind to not be distracted and keep focus. If you keep getting distracted it's not that you're not meditating properly, the getting distracted and refocussing your mind is part of the meditation process, its training your mind to focus.
          </p>
          <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
          <p>
            The starting technique suggested of just extending the 2 minutes of mindfulness covered in the previous chapter seemed like a good way to go about it.
          </p>
          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>
            It was interesting reading about the scientific studies done into meditation and that there were possible tangible benefits seen in these.
