          <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
          <p>
            When I'm programming, something not working that should be triggers frustration. I am generally able to keep this in control and try to figure out what's wrong. But I know that as the frustration builds I start to overlook simpler and simpler things. Because of this sometimes it gets to a point where it is better to abandon what I'm doing and come back to it later after the frustration subsides. Otherwise if I continue I'll just get more frustrated and won't be making any progress.

          <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
          <p>
            I liked this technique and feel that it is an excellent way to deal with negative emotions. I think I need to practice it when genuine times of emotional stress come up. I wasn’t able to bring up negative emotion just by thinking about a past trigger. I can remember times I felt emotional but I don’t hold onto the emotion itself enough to be able to bring it back. I could defiantly do to improve on my self-control with these techniques. Generally, I can bring my emotions into control very quickly but they do sometimes linger for a few hours. I'm in control and not letting my emotions control me during this time but it is distracting and makes it hard to focus. When more triggers happen while I'm still processing a previous emotion it gets harder to deal with and they can build up. If this technique can help me process and let go of emotion at the same time as getting it under control it would be very beneficial.
