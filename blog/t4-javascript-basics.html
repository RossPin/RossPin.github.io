          <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
          <p>
            HTML and CSS are basic languages used to display a web page in a browser. They are very good for doing what they are designed for but are limited to displaying a webpage. JavaScript on the other hand is a full computer programming language and can be used to do anything that can be done with a computer.
          </p>
          <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
          <p>
            Control flow is the step by step instructions a computer takes when executing a program. A loop is the instruction to repeat a given set of instructions for a given number of times or until a condition is met. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple example would be getting up to answer the door, the program is executed when the doorbell rings, for simplicity this is a single room with no obstacles. 
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Stand up.</li>
            <li>Face door.</li>
            <li>
              Until at door: 
              <ul>
                <li>Take a step.</li>
                <li>If not at door, repeat step 3.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Open door.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The first two are single instructions, they are executed then forgotten about and we move on to the next instruction. Then we have a loop to walk to the door, this consist of taking a step, check if we are at the door, if not repeat i.e. take another step. This is repeated until the loop condition is met, we are at the door. Once the loop is complete we move onto the next instruction and open the door. This program is now complete and we execute another program to engage with the person at the door.
          </p>
          <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
          <p>
            An array is essentially a list of data. Data in the list can only be accessed by its index in the list. Think of it as a book with no contents list. You can look at any page but unless you know which page has the information you want, you may have to look at every page to find what you want. 
          </p>
          <p>
            An object is similar to an array with the addition that every item in the list has a property name to identify it. This means that to access data in an object you don't need to know what position in the list it is. As long as you know the property name of the data you want you can go straight to it. Data in an object can also be accessed by its index like a standard array.
          </p>
          <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
          <p>
            Functions are a section of code that is only run if it is called for. It can be run as many times as it's called and can be passed data when it is called and return data when it's finished.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are useful because they can be used to run code whenever required just by calling the function. The code to be run only needs to be written once inside the function, rather than writing the code out every time it is needed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions that take data can be very useful as they can be written to process what is given to it and return a result. They are great when a similar process is needed to be operated on different data as you can simply call the function with the data you need processed.
