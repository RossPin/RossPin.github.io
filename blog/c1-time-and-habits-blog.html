        <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
        <p>
          I tried the timebox technique on reading the time and habit resources. After the hour timebox we were instructed to use was up, I wasn’t finished reading the materials. Instead of just carrying on as fast as I could, I took a break and reflected on what I had done. I felt reading the material deserved more time allocated to the task so I allowed another half hour session to finish reading the materials.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
        <p>
          I found BJ Foggs’ TED talk very interesting, I like his method of slowly changing behaviour over the long term. Assigning small tasks to do with the desired behaviour to be undertaken every time a ‘trigger’ event happens. This seems like a very effective way of developing new habits.
        </p>
        <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
        <p>
          The pomodoro technique and timebox are techniques that work for me. I have been setting time periods to sit down and work for, usually 1 or 2 hours. I’ll take a break once that’s up, it’s usually much easier to get back into the task after. If I think about how long the whole task is going to take I often find myself procrastinating and find it very hard to start the task at all.
        </p>
        <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
        <p>
          I will experiment more with the pomodoro technique and timebox. They match with my techniques for getting stuff done. I could improve my time management by following the techniques as they are described in the resources closer, rather than the rough versions I currently use. Getting a timer and working to strict, short, timebox periods as described in pomodoro technique could be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also like to experiment with BJ Foggs’ behaviour modification methods to form good habits.
