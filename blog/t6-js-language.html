          <h4>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of: </h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Parentheses () </strong>Are used to define or call a function. They follow the function name and any values that are to be passed to the or received by the function are placed between the parentheses. When calling or defining a function that has no values passed to it open and closing parentheses should be used with nothing inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brackets [] </strong>Are used to define an array, with the contents of the array placed between the brackets. They are also used when accessing an array or object, with the index or property to be accessed inside the brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Braces {} </strong>Are used to group lines of code together. Commonly uses for this are in functions and conditional statements. They contain the code to be executed when the function or conditional statement is run. All code contained in braces are part of the instance where the braces open and are separate from other lines of code. Braces are also used to define an object, all properties of the object are contained within the braces.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Single and Double Quotes ' '/" " </strong>Are used to surround a string. Either single or double quotes can be used for this. The string will start at the first instance of either of these and close at the second instance of the same one that opened it. In JavaScript they both have the same effect, but because the string needs to be closed with the same type that opened it the other type can be used as part of the string. Therefore if you want a double quote in the string it should be started with a single quote and vice versa. If The same type that started the string is to be used as part of the string escape characters must be used.
